## Methodology Manifesto

This project monitors the stability of public knowledge sources using
metadata-based longitudinal observation.

- Unit of analysis: individual article URLs
- No content is stored or archived
- No scraping of page text or structure
- Observations rely on HTTP-level signals only

The goal is not to preserve content, but to assess citation risk,
volatility, and long-term reliability of knowledge references.

Absence of change is treated as a valid observation.
